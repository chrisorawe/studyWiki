====== CSS Pre-Processors ======
Created Tuesday 31 October 2017

A CSS preprocessor helps you write maintainable, future-proof code and it will seriously reduce the amount of CSS you have to write. Where these tools shine best are in large-scale user interfaces that require huge stylesheets and many style rules.

A CSS preprocessor is a program that lets you generate CSS from the preprocessor's own unique syntax. There are many CSS preprocessors to choose from, however most CSS preprocessors will add some features that don't exist in pure CSS, such as variable, mixin, nesting selector, and so on. These features make the CSS structure more readable and easier to maintain.

To use a CSS preprocessor, you must install a CSS compiler on your web server.
